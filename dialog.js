then again, it's been five years since the last meeting. taking a seat on a familiar plastic bench, you look around, taking in the view of your middle school campus covered in snow. you might be more nostalgic if <a onclick="log(dialog.LOG1)">the news</a> wasn't so grave.`

`another one, to be clear. it's as tragic as it is ironic. the necromancy club has never stopped haunting you, not after you moved away, not now that you're an adult. so it wasn't all that shocking, when you read <a onclick="browse('email.com')">the invitation</a>. almost like you had been anticipating something like this.`

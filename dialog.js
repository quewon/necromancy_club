`dear rosie,
<br /><br />
come to the middle school next thursday, six pm, at the benches behind the courtyard. our founder has passed away. it won't be the funeral; the bayers have requested to hold it privately. but i hope we can come together once again in memory of the person that brought us together.
<br /><br />
